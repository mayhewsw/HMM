HMM
===

A simple implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for unsupervised learning of the parameters of an HMM.

This also implements the Cave-Neuwirth experiment. (In short, this is just treating the English language as a sequence of characters and learning HMM parameters from this sequence. There are some interesting insights).

This relies on:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* a text file called textdata.txt (just text)
